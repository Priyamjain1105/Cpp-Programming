# Object Oriented Programming
Binding the data and Function together and operate on them

## Type of Object Oriented Programming
1. **Class**: It is a user defined datatype has its own (Data Member and Member Function), Which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
2. **Object**:instance of class,  
              memory get allocated when object of class is created.
3. **Encapsulation**: Binding the data and functions that manipulate them
4. **Abstraction**: Displaying only essential information and hinding the details.
5. **Polymorphism**: Ability of a message to be displaced in more than one form  
    Operator Overloading  
    Function Overloading  

6. **Inheritance:** derive properties and characterstics from another class is called inheritance

## Construtor and Destructor
Member function named as class, called when obj is created or destroyed.

## Acess Modifier
1. Public
2. Private
3. Protected

## Structure VS Class
_Class_: Members and base classes are **private by default**.  
_Structure_: Members and base classes are **public by default**.  
Note: Structure: Collection of dissimilar data

## Local Classes in C++
A class declared inside a function, (loacl to that function)

## C vs C++
1. C supports procedural programming, C++ is hybird (procedural and object oriented)
2. C dont have oops(polymorphism,encapsulation,inheritance), C++ has all of them
3. C contains 32 keywords, C++ Contains 52 keywords
4. C is Function driven language, C++ Object driven language
5. C doesnt have function and operator overloading, C++ supports both of them
6. C does'nt have exceptional handeling, C++ has it.

## Inline Function
it is a request not command, code is inserted to the line where it is called.
```
inline int example()
       {
         //code
       }
```
