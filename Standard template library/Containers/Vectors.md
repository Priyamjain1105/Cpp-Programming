# Vectors
General array is defined as `int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}` here we cannot modify the size of the array.  
Vectors containers used when we do not know the size of the particular data structure.  

## Defination
Library `#include <vector>`  
Defining `vector<int> v;` or `vector<int> v(5);`

## Adding Element to Vectors
`v.push_back(2);`
